### **Hello, I'm James**!

- 💻 I am currently working as a Junior DevOps Engineer for Sparta Global. 

- ✈️ I am an Aerospace Engineering graduate and have 3 years experience as a Process engineer in the aviation industry. 

- 🌱 I am currently learning Infrastructure as Code, in particular using tools such as ansible and terraform.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started running in early 2022 and since then, I have completed 6 half marathons and the London Marathon.
